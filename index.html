                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in California, raised in Virginia, and now live in Utah. I first was a music performance major (piano) and
                    now a software enginering major. When I lived in Virginia I was around 4 miles away from Thomas Jefferson's summer house, and around 30
                    minuites away from where the civil war started to end.
                     I currently work at Vasion as a Product Support Engineer. I also play piano and used to do
                    some competitions. My favorite composers are Rachmaninoff, Liszt, and Prokofieff. I also am a big history buff mostly around
                    WW2, WW1, and some of the victorian age.
